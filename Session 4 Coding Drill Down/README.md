I Designed Neural Network in Three Steps in order to Increase the Accuracy of Neural Network on MNIST Dataset. I have uploaded three notebooks to indicate the number 
of steps taken to arrive at the Final Network. Below I have Mentioned the Target, Results and Analysis of the Network at Eact Step 

Step 1 :- 

Target :- 
To Design a Basic Neural Network with all the necessary Functions like Optimizer, loss, train and test. 

Result :- 
Total Params - 29,674
Best Train Accuracy - 98.82 %
Best Test Accuracy - 98.38 %

Analysis :-
It is a Good Model but heavy in terms of where we want it to be and also there is sign of overfitting in the End.

Step 2 :- 

Target :-
To Optimize the Neural Network designed in Step 1 in terms of Number of Parameters and also add Batch Normalization to the Network

Result :- 
Total Params - 6,778
Best Train Accuracy - 98.91 %
Best Test Accuracy - 99.45 %

Analysis :- 
It is a Light Model with Good Improvement in terms of accuracy as well as in terms of number of Parameters is concerned but still signs of overfitting seems to be there.

Step 3 :- 

Target :-
To Optimize the Neural Network to achieve 99.4% accuracy consistently in last few epochs and remove overfitting issue with dropout

Result :- 
Total Params - 7,658
Best Train Accuracy - 98.97 %
Best Test Accuracy - 98.33 %

Analysis :- 
It is a Good Model which shows signs of Improvement in terms of Accuracy as we are reaching more epochs as well as overfitting issue is not there but the model is not good enough to achieve the desired accuracy within 15 Epochs. There is scope for further Improvement.
