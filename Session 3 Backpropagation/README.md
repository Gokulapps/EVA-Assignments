Part 1

This Folder has Excel File along with some Images as a Part 1 Assignment where the Gradients and BackPropagation values for a Simple FC Network (shown in Excel File) is Calculated and tested with different Values of Learning Rate. In the Excel File, all the Major Steps required to calculate the BackPropagation Values is mentioned along with Network Diagram. Attaching Below Some Images for the Loss Graph Calculated with different Values of Learning Rate along with the Screenshot depicting the Entire BackPropagation Process.

                                                   Entire BackPropagation Values calculated for the Network
